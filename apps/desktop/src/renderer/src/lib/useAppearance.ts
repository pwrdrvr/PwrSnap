// Responsibilities:
//
//   1. Reconcile a starting theme from (settings snapshot ?? cached
//      bootstrap ?? "system") and apply the `data-theme` attribute on
//      `<html>` synchronously on first render.
//   2. Subscribe to OS `prefers-color-scheme` flips while theme ===
//      "system", and re-apply on change.
//   3. When the caller writes a new theme, persist it to Settings
//      (source of truth) AND mirror it to localStorage (first-paint
//      cache the pre-React bootstrap in index.html reads).
//   4. Adopt updates that arrive via the Settings broadcast (cross-
//      window sync — a write in the Settings window propagates to
//      the Library, the tray, the float-over, etc.) without echoing
//      back through the writer.
//
// Call this once at the App root per BrowserWindow. Each window has
// its own React tree and its own document; each needs the OS-sync
// listener wired locally.
